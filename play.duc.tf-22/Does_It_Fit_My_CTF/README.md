#### Challenge:

Cheers for that, I'm assuming you've worked out that I'm YouTuber... What's my channel name?

Note: This challenge assumes you have solved "Honk Honk" before attempting.

Flag format: Channel Name with no spaces, case insensitive </br>
Flag example: `DUCTF{LofiGirl}`

---

#### Solution:

Since the challenge description refers to the [previous challenge](../Honk_Honk/README.md), I googled for the type of the car that was found in it - `NISSAN MARCH 3 DOOR TURBO SEDAN youtube` and landed at the channel [MightyCarMods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8f2n1OOAgA&ab_channel=MightyCarMods).
