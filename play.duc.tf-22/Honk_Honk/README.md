#### Challenge:

I'm shocking when it comes to remembering when my car's CTP is up...can you let me know the exact date (DD/MM/YYYY) when it's due? My rego is 23HONK.

Flag format: `DUCTF{DD/MM/YYYY}` </br>
Flag example: `DUCTF{04/05/2022}`

Note: Solving this challenge unlocks another OSINT challenge.
