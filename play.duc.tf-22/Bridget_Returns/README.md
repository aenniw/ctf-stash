#### Challenge:

Bridget is back, she's asked me to meet her at: `download.pausing.counterparts`

What is the name of the bridge she's meeting me on?

Flag format: The name of the bridge with no spaces, case insensitive

#### Solution:

I remembered, that I have once read about a [site](https://what3words.com/download.pausing.counterparts) that translates words into coordinates.

The bridge name is the answer.
