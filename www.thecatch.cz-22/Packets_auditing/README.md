#### Challenge:

Hi, packet inspector,

the AI has "upgraded" our packet auditing system &ndash; time to time, it generates archive of pictures, where the state of packet and the appropriate delivery team is indicated by different colours for each packet transport number.

We have a plea from `Brenda's delivery team` to find their missing packet in state `ready for pickup` (the other teams have already delivered all their packages mentioned in last given audit archive).

 Download [audit archive](https://owncloud.cesnet.cz/index.php/s/BGSbaBDCsuWdAYO) (MD5 checksum `08ee155d2c9aee13ea5cab0a11196129`), find the desired pickup code and enter it on webpage [http://pickup.mysterious-delivery.thecatch.cz](http://pickup.mysterious-delivery.thecatch.cz) to collect pickup code.

May the Packet be with you!
