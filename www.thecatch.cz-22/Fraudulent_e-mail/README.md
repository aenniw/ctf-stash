#### Challenge:

Hi, packet inspector,

we have a apparently problem with some fraudulent payment gateway (see forwarded e-mail). We suspect that many of our customers have come across this scam.

Identify all card numbers entered into the fraudulent webpage (we have to report incident and its details to CSIRT-TCC).

Download [fraudulent e-mail](./fraudulent_e-mail.zip ":ignore") (MD5 checksum `94c7696bed436cd63a490de4008d2022`).

May the Packet be with you!
