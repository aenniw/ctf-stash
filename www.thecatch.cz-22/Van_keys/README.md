#### Challenge:

Hi, packet inspector,

all our delivery vans use password instead of standard car keys. Today, we have found out that the AI has implemented a new security measure &ndash; the vans are now referred as "AES Vans" and the password has been changed and encrypted. The decryption part is not yet finished, so we can't start any delivery van since morning!

Good news is that we managed to get the latest version of the decryption script from git repository. Bad news is that the script is not finished yet! Your task is to the finalize the script and decrypt the password as soon as possible. 

Download [the script and encrypted password](./van_keys.zip ":ignore") (MD5 checksum `e67c86a277b0d8001ea5b3e8f6eb6868`).

May the Packet be with you!
