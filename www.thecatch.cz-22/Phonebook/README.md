#### Challenge:

Hi, packet inspector,

you should already get access to the phone book &ndash; as a new employee &ndash; but the AI is too busy right now. This condition can last several ... who knows ... years?

Your task is to gain access to the application running on [http://phonebook.mysterious-delivery.tcc:40000](http://phonebook.mysterious-delivery.tcc:40000).

May the Packet be with you!
