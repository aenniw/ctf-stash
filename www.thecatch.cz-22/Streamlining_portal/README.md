#### Challenge:

Hi, packet inspector,

the AI is preparing some kind of employee streamlining portal on [http://user-info.mysterious-delivery.tcc](http://user-info.mysterious-delivery.tcc). We fear this will lead to more lost packages.

Your task is to break into the web and find interesting information on the server.

May the Packet be with you!
