#### Challenge:

Hi, promising candidate,

the cleaning drones have taken pictures of some abandoned unknown package in our backup depot. The AI claims that the analysed item is in no way a package, instead it repeats "cat - animal - dangerous - avoid".

Get as much as possible information about the package.

Download [taken pictures](https://owncloud.cesnet.cz/index.php/s/YxcC6BP430nR5en) (MD5 checksum `c6f700e1217c0b17b7d3a35081c9fabe`).

May the Packet be with you!
