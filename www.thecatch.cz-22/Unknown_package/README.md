#### Challenge:

Hi, promising candidate,

the cleaning drones have taken pictures of some abandoned unknown package in our backup depot. The AI claims that the analyzed item is in no way a package, instead it repeats "cat - animal - dangerous - avoid".

Get as much as possible information about the package.

Download [taken pictures](./unknown_package.zip ":ignore") (MD5 checksum `c6f700e1217c0b17b7d3a35081c9fabe`).

May the Packet be with you!
