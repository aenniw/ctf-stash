#### Challenge:

Embark on 'Dizzy', a carousel ride through cryptography! This warmup challenge spins you around the basics of ciphers and keys. Sharpen your mind, find the flag, and remember - in crypto, it's fun to get a little dizzy!

```T4 l16 _36 510 _27 s26 _11 320 414 {6 }39 C2 T0 m28 317 y35 d31 F1 m22 g19 d38 z34 423 l15 329 c12 ;37 19 h13 _30 F5 t7 C3 325 z33 _21 h8 n18 132 k24```

#### Solution:

There are several groups of symbols and numbers, noting that `{6`  gave me an idea that the group always consists of the `plaintext symbol` and its `order` (zero based) in the final flag. Sorting the symbols based on their order gives the flag.
