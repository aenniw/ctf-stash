#### Challenge:

Ahoy, deck cadet,

your task is to prepare good coffee for captain. As a cadet, you are prohibited from going to the captain's cabin, so you will have to solve the task remotely. Good news is that the coffee maker in captain's cabin is online and can be managed via API. 

May you have fair winds and following seas!

Coffee maker API is available at <a href="http://coffee-maker.cns-jv.tcc" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;coffee-maker.cns-jv.tcc</a>.
