#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

after a reboot at 2023-10-02 11:30:18 UTC, the On-board signal flag recognition system (OBSF-RS) has malfunctioned. The signal flags are no more recognized and the only working function is to generate and save schematic views, which are created every time a ship in the vicinity changes its signaling. We need to know what the surrounding ships signaled and if we have missed something important.

May you have fair winds and following seas!
