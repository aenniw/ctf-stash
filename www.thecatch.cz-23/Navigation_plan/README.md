#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

the chief officer was invited to a naval espresso by the captain and now they are both unfit for duty. The second officer is very busy and he has asked you to find out where are we heading according to the navigation plan.

May you have fair winds and following seas!

The navigation plan webpage is available at <a href="http://navigation-plan.cns-jv.tcc" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;navigation-plan.cns-jv.tcc</a>.
