#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

on our last port visit, a new U.S.A. (Universal Ship API) interface was installed on the ship. In order to unlock new experimental ship functions, the special code has to be entered into ship FLAG (First Layer Application Gateway). Your task is to get this FLAG code from U.S.A.

May you have fair winds and following seas!

The U.S.A. is available at <a href="http://universal-ship-api.cns-jv.tcc" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;universal-ship-api.cns-jv.tcc</a>.

#### Solution:

```bash
```

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
FLAG{910P-iUeJ-Wwq1-i8L2}
```

</details>
