#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

one of deck cadets (remember your early days onboard) had a simple task to prepare simple web application to announce keyword of the day. He claimed that the task is completed, but he forgot on which port the application is running. Unfortunately, he also prepared a lot of fake applications, he claims it was necessary for security reasons. Find the keyword of the day, so daily routines on ship can continue. 

May you have fair winds and following seas!

The webs are running somewhere on server `keyword-of-the-day.cns-jv.tcc`.
