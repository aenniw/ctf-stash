#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

our captain has had too much naval espresso and is temporary unfit for duty. The chief officer is in command now, but he does not know the captain's passwords for key ship systems.  Good news is that the captain uses password manager and ship chief engineer was able to acquire captain's computer memory crash dump. Your task is to acquire password for signalization system. 

May you have fair winds and following seas!
