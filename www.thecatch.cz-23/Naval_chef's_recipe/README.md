#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

 some of the crew started behaving strangely after eating the chef's speciality of the day -  they apparently have hallucinations, because they are talking about sirens wailing,  kraken on starboard, and accussed the chef being reptilian spy. Paramedics are getting crazy, because the chef refuses to reveal what he used to make the food. Your task is to find his secret recipe. It should be easy as the chef knows only security by obscurity and he has registered domain `chef-menu.galley.cns-jv.tcc`. 
May you have fair winds and following seas!

The chef's domain is `chef-menu.galley.cns-jv.tcc`.
