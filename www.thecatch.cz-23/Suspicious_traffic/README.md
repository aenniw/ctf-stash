#### Challenge:

Ahoy, officer,

the chief security officer has told you, he came across a very suspicious event in ship's security logs on the occasion of a planned monthly log check. The event is related to accessing the secret file `secret.db` on server on cargo deck. Luckily, the ship is equipped with an automatic network traffic recorder, which was activated by the suspicious event and provided corresponding packet capture. Your task is to confirm that the mentioned file has been exfiltrated and to examine its contents. 

May you have fair winds and following seas!
