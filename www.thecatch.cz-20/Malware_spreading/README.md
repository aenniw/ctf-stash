#### Challenge:

Hi, executive senior investigator!

We suspect that the malware is primarily spreaded somehow by e-mail. We have partial traffic dump from one small company, that was attacked. Try to check this hypothesis. [malware_spreading.tar.xz](./malware_spreading.tar.xz ":ignore")

Good Luck!
