#### Challenge:

Hi, executive senior investigator! 

We have managed to get a rare catch - a traffic dump of issuing commands for the C2 server by its master! Glory to the network specialists of unnamed company. Try to find out how this communication works. [botnet_master.tar.xz](./botnet_master.tar.xz ":ignore")

Our network analytics report that one of currently online C2 servers can be found on IP `78.128.216.92` on `TCP/20220`.

Good luck!
