#### Challenge:

Hi executive senior investigator! 

Cool, you have found the malware dropped on target computer.  According to your defined procedure and your previously detected IoC (indicators of compromise), we were able to find other versions of malware in traffic dumps - we assume it is some kind of botnet client. Unfortunatelly, it looks like the C2 server has been meanwhile upgraded and although the server reacts to client's messages, the client can't decode the orders. You should investigate the communication.  [the_connection.tar.xz](./the_connection.tar.xz ":ignore")

Good luck!
