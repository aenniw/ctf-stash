#### Challenge:

Hi, executive senior investigator! 

The file, you have acquired in previous investigation is not the malware, we were looking for. The attacker probably replaced it to fool us. Fortunatelly, we have a traffic dump, where you can probably find the original file. Try to find it and do not forget to be sure it is the correct file. [downloaded_file.tar.xz](./downloaded_file.tar.xz ":ignore")

Good luck!
