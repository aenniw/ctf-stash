#### Challenge:

After an open battle, and thanks to the super strength of IronCode, R-Boy manages to get hold of the file. But itâ€™s a trap. IronCode and R-boy are stuck into the file and the only way to get out is through a labyrinth of codes! Solve the problems in the maze and help the two heroes escape!

#### Solution:

This challenge is standard coding challenge focusing on finding shortest path in the graph but it is made a bit more difficult by introducing few special conditions, like the paths have two dimensional "costs" - `time` and `energy`, also you can visit a specific node only in specific "time range". These conditions are in itself a good things, because they significantly reduce the number of permutations. Also recursion is the only way how to compute this in reasonable time. After finding the correct path, it provides us with the password to the `ZIP` archive containing the flag.
