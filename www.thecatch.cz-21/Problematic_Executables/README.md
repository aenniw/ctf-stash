#### Challenge:

Hi Expert, 

some unhappy archaeologist tells you about her problems with examination of some executable - it always ends with `Alarm! Bad usage! Alarm!`. Luckily, part of the original code was retrieved, but no cuneiform, hieroglyphs or cat pictures were present, so the archaeologist cannot understand it. Prove you skill and found how to run the executable.
