#### Challenge:

Regeneration spans the universe and all possible universes: a point of contact between space and time that brings the subject back to life in a new body, leaving last damage in the souls of those who undergo it, with unforeseen influences that can also fracture time. R-Boy awakes and has the solution in his pocket, but he does not feel like embarking on such a selfish path. He decides to embrace his own “end of days”.
