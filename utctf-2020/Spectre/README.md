#### Challenge:

I found this audio file, but I don't think it's any song I've ever heard... Maybe there's something else inside? [song.wav](./song.wav ":ignore")

---

#### Solution:

The name of the challenge hints to `spectrogram` and simple display of spectrogram (e.g. in `audacity`) reveals the flag.

![spectre.png](./spectre.png ":ignore")
