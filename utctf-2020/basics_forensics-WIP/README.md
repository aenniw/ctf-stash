#### Challenge:

My friend said they hid a flag in this picture, but it's broken! Now that I think about it, I don't even know if it really is a picture... [secret.jpeg.tar.lzma](./secret.jpeg.tar.lzma ":ignore")

---

#### Solution:

```bash

```

---

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```

```

</details>
