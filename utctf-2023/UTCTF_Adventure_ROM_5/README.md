#### Challenge:

NOTE: The binary has been patched as of T+4.5H since CTF start. You should now be able to see a "YOU LOSE" message after reaching the bottom of the game.

I found this mysterious cartridge at the Nintendo headquarters, I think it might be some sort of prototype, can you find out how to beat the game?

Note: The flag appears in non-standard notation, in the form "UTFLAG ABCDEFGH"
