#### Challenge:

NOTE: `echo 'Hello world'` is the only "allowed" command. Do not bruteforce other commands.

One of our spies has stolen documentation relating to a new class of missiles. Can you figure out how to hack them?

"We have developed a new protocol to allow reprogramming missiles in flight. We send a base64 encoded string representing a specifically formatted zip file to control these missiles. The missiles themselves verify each command before executing them to ensure that a hacker cannot manipulate them."

A sample message has also been stolen by our spy.
