#### Challenge:

I've included the flag in as shell command. Can you retrieve it?

I recommend using the [volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) software for this challenge.

Here is the memory dump: [debian11.core.zst](https://utexas.box.com/s/fehluzyox4bbgfjlz061r2k7k2sek3cw)  
This problem also comes with a free profile! [debian11_5.10.0-21.json.zst](https://utexas.box.com/s/g64kezqvkqhm6nw79oovcekn9z1w66q0)  
Both of these files are compressed using `zstd`.

This challenge's flag looks like a UUID.

> Note: the volatility challenges do not have a flag format to discourage grepping. They all should be possible without guessing. If you have trouble, remember that you can ask for help.
