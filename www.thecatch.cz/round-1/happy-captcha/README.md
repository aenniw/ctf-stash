#### Challenge:

Agent, we have discovered a service protected by a very peculiar CAPTCHA mechanism. If we can beat it using a computer, we might me able to enumerate the service and get a lot of information. That will take a lot of requests and we just don't have the manpower to do these CAPTCHAs by hand. To pass the CAPTCHA you need to identify "happy" smiley faces. Then lookup their R, G and B color channels. For each channel, xor together the values of all "happy" smileys and present the results to the CAPTCHA mechanism. You only get one try per image. Submit your results via POST or GET (whichever you like). Submit the values in decimal. Use parameters names of `r` (for the _red_ channel), `g` and `b`. There is also a time limit present! You have up to 5 seconds to submit your answer. [http://challenges.thecatch.cz:10001/](http://challenges.thecatch.cz:10001/) Good luck, Agent
