### The Process

#### Challenge:

Agent, this is a mission of the upmost importance! Thanks to a badly configured firewall we have managed to infiltrate the Mission Control Center of the enemy. From there they are able to communicate with their massive satellite network - and now, so are we! We are unable to give you direct access, but we will act as the middle man and relay any communication via our gateway, accessible at `challenges.thecatch.cz:10161`. The initial analysis report has not yet come in, so we can't help you further. You need to figure out what protocol is in use. You are to retrieve the security code which is being used to communicate with the satellite network. We will take it from there. Best of luck, Agent!

### Cookie 2

#### Challenge:

Agent, from the recent network logs, we found that enemy spies often visit the following URL: http://challenges.thecatch.cz/Cookie2.php Go and discover what secret it keeps. Good luck!
