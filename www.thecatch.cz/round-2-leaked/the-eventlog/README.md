#### Challenge:

Agent, we need your skills! Foreign blonde agent Pamela forgot her laptop in the caf√© and our agency got it. Unfortunately, all user files are encrypted with something called `Advanced_Quantum_Prediction_Mk3` and we are not able to break it. However, Pamela has used an encryption application `Agency Secure Communicator` in the debug mode, which could leave useful traces. Analyse the event log and try to find some messages in plain text if possible. Good luck, Agent. [asc.evtx](./asc.evtx ':ignore')
