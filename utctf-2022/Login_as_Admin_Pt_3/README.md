#### Challenge:

Ok sorry but just *one* more time. HQ really needs your help. These Web D-EVIL-opers keep changing their site and preventing us from logging in. It seems the one thing they _won't_ change is their username and password \*rolls eyes\*. Can you figure out how to log in?

_FYI, you do *not* need to do the 'Login as Admin' sequence in order, and later parts are not necessarily harder than earlier ones._

[app.py](./app.py ":ignore") `http://web1.utctf.live:2363`

#### Solution:

```bash
