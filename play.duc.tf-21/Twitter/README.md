#### Challenge:

If you have been paying attention to our Twitter, we have been using flags in the background of our graphics this year. However, one of these flags stands out a bit more than the rest! Can you find it?

While you're there, why don't you give us a follow to keep up to date with DownUnderCTF!

#### Solution:

- going through `DUCTF` twitter posts reveals flag in one the posts
