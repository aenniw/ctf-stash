#### Challenge:

We found some files on the website (not really), the caption was â€œRight at the heart of the nation, no piece of the bush inside the circle remains untouched by us".

We believe this is one of their meeting places, can you help us find the location of the photo truncated (not rounded) to three decimal places?

Flag format is `DUCTF{lon,lat}` [image.jpg](./image.jpg ":ignore")

---

#### Solution:

```bash
```

---

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
DUCTF{-35.306,149.120}
```

</details>
