#### Challenge:

We found some files on the website (not really), the caption was â€œRight at the heart of the nation, no piece of the bush inside the circle remains untouched by us".

We believe this is one of their meeting places, can you help us find the location of the photo truncated (not rounded) to three decimal places?

Flag format: `DUCTF{lon,lat}`

#### Solution:

`Hearth of the nation` probably refers to the capital of Australia - `Canbera`. On the map there can be seen huge `circle` with the `Parliament House` in the centre.
Looking around using `google street view` reveals [the location](https://www.google.com/maps/@-35.3069353,149.1207075,3a,90y,343.33h,59.03t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPJRYW9yV-_2WiGVhVd6HcBxvGcvUAUyDcZ_MNd!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPJRYW9yV-_2WiGVhVd6HcBxvGcvUAUyDcZ_MNd%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya78.37615-ro-0-fo100!7i6656!8i3328) in the provided image.
