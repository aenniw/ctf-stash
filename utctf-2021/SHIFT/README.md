#### Challenge:

I just tried to download this flag, but it looks like the image got messed up in transit...

[SHIFT.png](./SHIFT.png ":ignore")

#### Solution:

We are presented with image that seems to be containing the flag. Using [www3.lunapic.com](https://www3.lunapic.com/editor/) and applying `skew image` to the left 6 times.
