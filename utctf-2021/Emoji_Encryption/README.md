#### Solution:

Based on the format of the flag - `utflag{xxxxxxx}` it is obvious that first letter of the object that emoji represents is the letter of the plaintext, so with decent English skills it can be deciphered manually quite quickly. While writing the writeup I come across the site (https://emojipedia.org/)[https://emojipedia.org/], which could help non-english speakers, or could be used to write script for this task.
