#### Challenge:

My friend sent me this text file and said they put a flag inside. I opened it and it doesn't look like a normal text file to me! Maybe you'll be able to find it.

[out.txt](./out.txt ":ignore")

---

#### Solution:

```bash
file out.txt
mv out.txt out.png
```

---

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```text
utflag{file_extensions_mean_nothing}
```

</details>
