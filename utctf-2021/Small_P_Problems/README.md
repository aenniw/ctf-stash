#### Challenge:

My buddies Whitfield and Martin were trying to share a secret key between themselves, and I was able to eavesdrop on their conversation. I bet I could probably figure out their shared secret with a little math...

```
p = 69691
g = 1001

A = 17016
B = 47643
```

**Note: submit either the shared secret or the shared secret wrapped in `utflag{}`**

---

#### Solution:

```bash
```

---

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
utflag{53919}
```

</details>
