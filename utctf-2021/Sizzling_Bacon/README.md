#### Challenge:

My buddy Francis is *really* into Bacon. He loves it so much that he gave me this encoded bacon-themed flag (he said he was inspired by the sound of sizzling bacon). 

```
sSsSSsSSssSSsSsSsSssSSSSSSSssS{SSSsSsSSSsSsSSSsSSsSSssssssSSSSSSSsSSSSSSSSsSSsssSSssSsSSSsSSsSSSSssssSSsssSSsSSsSSSs}
```

---

#### Solution:

```bash
```

---

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
utflag{crispybaconcipher}
```

</details>
<br/>
