#### Challenge:

R-Boy finds the time machine, which Zer0 used to travel to another era. Nearby, lies a copy of HG Wells’ The Time Machine. Could this book from the past help R-Boy travel in time? Unfortunately, R-Boy can’t read or understand it, because the space-time continuum has changed some of the words. Help R-Boy to start his time travels! [coding-100.zip](./coding-100.zip ":ignore")
