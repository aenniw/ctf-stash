#### Challenge:

R-Boy is suddenly thrown into a future post-apocalyptic era, arriving in the last ‘free human’ city. Everyone here is safe here, but the rest of the earth is ruled by Zer0. The all-seeing Zer0 has developed Antani, a new machine learning algorithm that uses the power of quantum computing to exploit humans as a ring in the master Tapioca blockchain.

The free humans have managed to steal a big file from a machine in an ancient building, which could reveal the key to Zer0’s power, defeat his terrible reign, and help R-boy return to the present.
