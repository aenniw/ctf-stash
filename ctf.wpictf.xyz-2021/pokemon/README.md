#### Solution:

We are given Pokemon Red game for the game boy console (nostalgic blast-from-the-past for me personally!), and we are told to defeat our rival. The problem is that the game is rigged, whatever pokemon we choose, our rival gets `MEWTWO (lvl 50)`. Playing the game in `visvisualboyadvance-m`, we can use cheat for instakill `0100E7CF` found at this [site](https://www.pokemoncoders.com/pokemon-red-cheats/). The rival will tell us the flag after he loses. (Note that the flag has round brackets, not the curly ones.)
