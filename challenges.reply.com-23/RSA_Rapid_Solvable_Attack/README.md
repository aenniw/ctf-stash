#### Challenge:

In the heart of the Misc Realm, R-Boy prepares for the decisive battle. He never expected to encounter an old foe: the master of the digital underworld in this realm is Zer0, someone he knows well. The atmosphere grows increasingly tense, and Zer0 reveals an ace up his sleeve: an extremely advanced Artificial Intelligence called "Nethra," programmed to predict and counter every move R-Boy makes. However, it seems that some clues for gaining an advantage have been disguised.
