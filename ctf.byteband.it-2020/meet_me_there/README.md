#### Challenge:

Bob asked Alice to make the keys easier to guess. She did it but to keep the data safe, she used two keys and encrypted the data twice. Can you prove that she is absolutely wrong by getting the flag? [output.txt](./output.txt ":ignore"), [source.py](./source.py ":ignore")

---

#### Solution:

```bash
```

---

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
flag{y0u_m@d3_i7_t0_7h3_m1dddl3}
```

</details>
