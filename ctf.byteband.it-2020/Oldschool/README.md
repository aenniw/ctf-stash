#### Challenge:

Part 1: Mr. Boomer recently visited France and encrypted the first part of the flag using something he learned there and put the encrypted data in 3. He said, "The key to figuring out what 3 says can only be found using 1 and 2".

Part 2: Mr. Boomer encoded the second part of the flag twice, using a different method each time. All he said was that the average was 74.5.
