#### Challenge:

Someone gave me two functions to convert strings into integers. I converted some strings to the integers and noted them down. Can you help me converting the concatenation of those strings in the order mentioned in the file `hashes.txt` into integers?

The answer for this is the multiplication of output of both the functions for the concatenated string. (Wrap the number around flag{})

[hash.zip](./hash.zip ":ignore")
