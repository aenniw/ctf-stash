#### Challenge:

We have 3D printed a great object, and wanted to show you... unfortunately we only have the video file of the [print.mp3](./3d_printer_goes_brrrrrr.mp3 ":ignore")... and it's corrupted.
But they say when you have 3d printed enough, you don't even hear the sounds. All you hear is blonde, brunette, redhead.
