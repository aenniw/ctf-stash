#### Challenge:

The Emperor accidentally installed a malware that made him lose everything because his credentials got stolen.

After analyzing his computer, we found multiple network communications with these domains:

``c2-securinets-2020.info``

``c2-securinets-2020.ovh``

``c2-securinets-2020.com``

``c2-securinets-2020.site``

Could you try to find the owner of at least one of these domains ?

The flag is in the owner name. You will find the flag already in this format Securinets{}. If you didn't find this, so you didn't find the flag.
