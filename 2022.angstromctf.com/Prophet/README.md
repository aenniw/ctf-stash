#### Challenge:

Clam's tired of the drab life of being a Python programmer. When he heard of the legendary ginkoid coding in Go, he knew it was his calling. Before embarking on his dangerous journey to becoming a Google shill, he encrypted his most valued flag the only way he knows how: pure randomness. It's a good thing he did, too, since Google sold all his data for 2 cents and caused him to forget the flag. Can you recover his flag?

#### Solution:

```bash
```

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
actf{i_c4n_f0rs33_th3_p4s7_t00_}
```

</details>
