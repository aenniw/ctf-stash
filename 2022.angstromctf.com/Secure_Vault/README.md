#### Challenge:

Clam saw all those cool celebrities posting everything they do on twitter, so he decided to give it a go himself. Turns out, that's a horrible idea. After recovering from his emotional trauma, he wrote a [secure vault](https://secure-vault.web.actf.co) to store his deepest secrets. Legend has it that there's even a flag in there. Can you get it?
