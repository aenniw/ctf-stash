#### Challenge:

After hearing about all of the cheating scandals, clam decided to conduct a sting operation for Ã¥ngstromCTF. He made [a database of fake flags](https://no-flags.web.actf.co) to see who submits them. Unbeknownst to him, a spy managed to sneak a **real** flag into his database. Can you find it?
