#### Challenge:

The new Justice League movies nerfed the Flash, so clam made [his own rendition](https://the-flash.web.actf.co)! Can you get the flag before the Flash swaps it out at the speed of light?

---

#### Solution:

Open up the devtools in browser and set break on subtree modification on the div where the flag is, then read the flag value.
