#### Challenge:

Can you crack this? Your hash: `a60458d2180258d47d7f7bef5236b33e86711ac926518ca4545ebf24cdc0b76c`. Your salt: the encryption method of the hash. (So if the hash is of the word `example`, you would submit `flag{example}` to score points.) UPDATE Friday 9PM: To streamline your efforts we would like to give you some more details about the format for the hash encryption method. An example: if you think the hash is RIPEMD-128, use `ripemd128` for the salt.
