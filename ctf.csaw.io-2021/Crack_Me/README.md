#### Challenge:

Can you crack this? Your hash: `a60458d2180258d47d7f7bef5236b33e86711ac926518ca4545ebf24cdc0b76c`. Your salt: the encryption method of the hash. (So if the hash is of the word `example`, you would submit `flag{example}` to score points.) UPDATE Friday 9PM: To streamline your efforts we would like to give you some more details about the format for the hash encryption method. An example: if you think the hash is RIPEMD-128, use `ripemd128` for the salt.

#### Solution:

The goal of this challenge was probably to run some script trying different encryption methods with some small dictinary, but nobody has time for that. I just googled the hash and found it on this [site](https://md5hashing.net/hash/sha256/a60458d2180258d47d7f7bef5236b33e86711ac926518ca4545ebf24cdc0b76c).
