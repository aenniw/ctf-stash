#### Challenge:

A hacker named Blue_Blur was recently arrested and is accused of hiding some evidence. The evidence was reported to have been hidden in the hacker's OC Sonic comic. See if you can find any hidden files. Reportedly, it was a 'video' of some sort. On the other hand, the comics are pretty good. Enjoy! :)

Credit goes to Deebs/Fini-mun for the artwork of the comics. [Fallout-New_Mobius.png](./Fallout-New_Mobius.png ":ignore")
