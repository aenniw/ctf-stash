#### Challenge:

Can you crack Aaron’s password hash? He seems to like simple passwords. I’m sure he’ll use his name and birthday in it. Hint: Aaron writes important dates as YYYYMMDD rather than YYYY-MM-DD or any other special character separator. Once you crack the password, prepend it with `flag{` and append it with `}` to submit the flag with our standard format. Hash: `7f4986da7d7b52fa81f98278e6ec9dcb`.

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>
