## Audio?!

HACKER1: FBI is onto me that is why I am sending you a hidden message in an audio file.
HACKER2: What? Audio file...how the hell is that safe.
H1: It is because audio has nothing to do with it.
H2: So how can I see it.
H1: Just check the spectro......

This was the conversation intercepted by FBI between two hackers. FBI has provided you with the audio file can you help then find the message?
The flag is not in the tryhackme{} format.

For submission add tryhackme{} around the found message. [flag.waw](./flag.waw ':ignore')
