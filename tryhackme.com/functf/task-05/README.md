## What a mess?!!

There are a lot of ways to mess a file. The most common one is to play with its headers.
NOTE: The flag is not in the tryhackme{}. For submission add tryhackme{} around the found flag. [flag.png](./flag.png ":ignore")

```bash
# Fix magic header - 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A
hexedit ./flag.png
```

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
tryhackme{LoL-m355ed_H34D3R5_FOR_th15?}
```

</details>
