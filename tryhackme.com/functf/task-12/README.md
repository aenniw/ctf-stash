Reversing is a really helpful skill. But it can really be stressful you know looking at the stack and thinking whether it's going up or is it going down. [flag](./flag ":ignore")

```bash
strings ./flag | grep == | base64 -d
```

<details><summary>FLAG:</summary>

```
tryhackme{s7r1ngs?_0r_r4b1n2?}
```

</details>
